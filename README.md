# PATH Data API

This repository contains the contract and server-side implementation of an API that exposes data about the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Rapid Transit System.

This software is not endorsed nor supported by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

# Public APIs

The APIs provided by this service can be found at: https://path.api.razza.dev/

# Demo

You can query the API via your web browser by navigating to a valid endpoint. For example the [9th street station realtime data](https://path.api.razza.dev/v1/stations/ninth_street/realtime).

A simple web app using the realtime arrival data can be found [here](https://jsfiddle.net/qkp7g8ze/embedded/result/).
